# Scheduled columns

Automatically re-run your enrichments on a set schedule.

Scheduled columns let you automatically re-run specific columns or entire tables on a recurring basis.

This keeps your data current without manual updates (e.g., keeping enrichment data up-to-date like company headcount, funding info, or tech stack changes).

## Scheduling column runs

1.  While in a table, click the `⛭` icon in the top toolbar.
2.  Under `Run Settings`, select Re-run columns `on a schedule`.
3.  Choose the frequency to run:
    1.  Hour (available on all paid plans)
    2.  Day
    3.  Week
    4.  Month
    5.  Custom — set a specific day of the week, time of day, and timezone (e.g., every Sunday at 6:00 AM Eastern Time).
4.  Decide whether you want to run `All columns` (the whole table) or `Only selected columns`.

## Action columns and scheduled re-runs

Scheduled column re-runs fire for **every row** in the table on each cycle — including rows that already have successful results. Unlike table-level Auto-run, scheduled column runs always force-run and do not respect the "Keep existing results" option.

**Avoid including action columns in a scheduled re-run.** Columns that perform an external action — such as sending a Slack message, writing to a CRM, or sending an email — will fire for every row on every scheduled cycle, not just new rows. This can produce duplicate Slack messages, duplicate CRM records, or repeated emails on rows that were already processed.

To control this:

-   **Remove action columns from the scheduled re-run list.** Open **Table Settings** → **Run Settings** → **Re-run columns on a schedule** and uncheck any action columns. With table-level Auto-run enabled, the action column still fires automatically when a new row is added — it just won't repeat for all existing rows on every cycle.
-   **Add a run condition to the action column.** In the column's **Run settings**, enable `Only run if` and set a condition that's false once the action has already completed — for example, `/SlackMessage is empty`. This prevents the column from re-running on rows that already have a result, even if it's included in a scheduled re-run.

Scheduled columns are best suited for data enrichment columns where refreshing values over time is the goal — for example, headcount, funding data, or job titles.

## Downstream columns after a scheduled run

Scheduled column runs force-run **only the selected columns**. After the scheduled column completes and its output updates, downstream columns that reference it follow Clay's normal auto-run rules:

-   **Default mode (Auto-run on, "All columns"):** If the scheduled column's output changed for a row, downstream columns automatically re-run on those rows. If the output is unchanged, downstream columns stay up to date and are not re-triggered.
-   **"Keep existing results" mode:** Downstream columns that already have results are marked "out of date" but are **not** automatically re-run. The scheduled run does not cascade to them.
-   **Downstream column auto-run off:** The downstream column is marked "out of date" but requires a manual trigger.

**To make a downstream column re-run on the same recurring cycle as the upstream scheduled column**, add it to the scheduled run list (**Table Settings → Run Settings → Re-run columns on a schedule → Only selected columns**). Scheduled column runs always force-run, so the downstream column executes every cycle regardless of "Keep existing results."

To prevent the downstream column from running on every row on every cycle — for example, if you only want it to execute when the upstream value meets a condition — add a run condition. In the downstream column's **Run settings**, enable **Add run condition** and enter a formula that references the upstream column's value (for example, `Only run when [Sentiment] contains "BULLISH" & [Full Name] is not empty`). Clay evaluates the condition on each row and skips rows where it is not met, so you only consume credits for rows where the upstream result warrants it. See [Conditional runs](conditional-runs.md) for setup details.

## Usage limits

Each plan has a limit to the total number of tables with scheduled columns.

-   Starter: 100 tables
-   Launch: 100 tables
-   Growth: 500 tables
-   Enterprise: 1000 tables
