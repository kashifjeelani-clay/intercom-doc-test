# Lead-to-account matching for Salesforce

Connect Salesforce leads with their corresponding Salesforce accounts.

Clay offers powerful lead-to-account matching capabilities that help you efficiently connect Salesforce leads with their corresponding Salesforce accounts. Here's everything you need to know about implementing this in your workflow.

### Three methods for Salesforce lead matching

Clay provides [three distinct approaches](https://www.clay.com/university/guide/salesforce-integration-overview#enriching-data-with-salesforce) for Salesforce lead-to-account matching, ranging from simple to advanced:

1.  **Plain lookup record:** Best for scenarios with unique identifiers like LinkedIn profiles or Salesforce account IDs. This is the simplest and most straightforward method for Salesforce integration.
2.  **Lookup record +** [**Clay formulas**](https://www.clay.com/university/lesson/ai-formulas-conditional-runs-clay-101)**:** More flexible approach that allows you to pull multiple Salesforce records and implement custom selection logic to choose the best match.
3.  **Lookup records via SOQL**: The most sophisticated method, offering precise matching capabilities and advanced acceptance criteria for complex Salesforce use cases.
