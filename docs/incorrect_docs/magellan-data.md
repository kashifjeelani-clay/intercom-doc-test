## Troubleshooting

### Account connects but actions return no data

If your Magellan Data account connects successfully but enrichments return no results, your Magellan account may have insufficient credits. Log in to your Magellan Data account to check your credit balance and purchase additional credits if needed. Note that credits are only consumed when matching data is found, so records with no results will not be charged.
