# Table alerts

Table alerts automatically monitor your Clay tables and notify you when something needs attention.

**Note:** Table Alerts is available for all Enterprise users.

Table alerts automatically monitor your Clay tables and notify you when something needs attention — whether error rates spike in a column, a table grows beyond an expected size, or a table stops receiving new data. Stay on top of data quality issues and workflow health without having to check your tables manually.

## **Setting up table alerts**

Table alerts are configured per table and are **opt-in** — you must explicitly enable alerts for each table and select which alert types you want active. To set up alerts:

1.  Navigate to your table.
2.  Click the **⚠️ warning icon** in the bottom-right corner to open the `Table alerts` panel.
3.  If alerts haven't been enabled yet, you'll see _"Alerts are not enabled for this table."_ Click `Configure alerts` — or click the **⚙️** icon in the panel header — to open `Alert settings`.
4.  Toggle on `Enable alerts` to turn on alerts for this table.
5.  Under `Alert Rules`, enable and configure each alert type individually:
    -   `Column failure rate` — alerts when a column's error rate exceeds a threshold. Default: **90%**.
        -   **Muting columns:** You can selectively choose which columns trigger alerts. By default, all columns are enabled for alerting. To mute specific columns:
            -   **Right-click** on a column header and select `Mute Alerts for Column`.
            -   Click the **three dots menu** on a column and select the muting option.
            -   Use the **Column Selector** (similar to Schedule Runs UI) to enable/disable columns in bulk. This is the recommended approach for focusing alerts on critical downstream columns only.
        -   When you add a new column to your table, it's automatically enabled for alerting by default.
        -   **Use case:** This is useful for non-critical upstream columns where errors are expected or acceptable. For example, if you only care about alerts for a critical downstream column like a Google Search enrichment, you can mute all other columns and enable alerting only for your critical column.
    -   `Row count limit` — alerts when your table's row count exceeds a threshold. Default: **45,000 rows**.
    -   `Data inactivity` — alerts when a table with a signal, scheduled signal, or scheduled run has received no new data for a configured period. Default: **3 days**.
6.  Click `Save`.

**Note:** Alert rules apply to all users on the table. Alerts must be enabled before they will appear in the feed.

## **Viewing and managing alerts**

### **Finding alerts in your table**

Once alerts are enabled and thresholds are configured, alerts will fire automatically when conditions are met.

1.  Look for the **⚠️ warning icon with a number** in the **bottom-right corner** of your table. The number represents the count of unresolved grouped alerts (not individual alert logs).
2.  Click the icon to open the `Table alerts` panel.
3.  Review the feed of all triggered alerts for that table.

**Grouped alerts:** Alerts of the same type and column are automatically grouped together in the feed to reduce clutter. Each grouped alert shows:

-   `Column name` — which column exceeded the error threshold (for column failure rate alerts).
-   `Unresolved logs count` — how many times this same error has triggered (e.g., "12 unresolved logs").
-   `Latest timestamp` — when the most recent alert fired.
-   `Threshold` — the value that was exceeded (e.g., "10% error rate threshold").
-   `Error cause` — the most recent error that occurred (e.g., "invalid API key").

**Viewing grouped alert details:**

Click any grouped alert to open a details panel showing:

-   **Latest error message** — displays the most recent threshold and error that triggered.
-   **Most recent errors** — shows the errors that occurred in the latest alert.
-   **Historical log** — a clickable list of all previous alerts for this column/type, including:
    -   Timestamp when each alert triggered
    -   Threshold at that time
    -   Error causes that occurred
    -   Resolve state of each log

Click any alert to automatically scroll to and highlight the relevant column in your table for faster investigation.

### **Managing your alerts**

From the `Table alerts` panel, you can:

-   `Mark as resolved` — resolves an individual grouped alert and updates the icon count in the bottom-right corner. Resolved alerts are grayed out visually.
-   `Mark all resolved` — clears all grouped alerts at once.
-   `Mark as unresolved` — **only unmarks the most recent alert** within a grouped alert. Historical logs remain resolved because only the latest alert is relevant for addressing the current issue.
-   `Hide resolved alerts` — toggles the view to show only active, unresolved alerts.

### **Checking current thresholds**

Click the **⚙️** icon in the `Table alerts` panel header at any time to view or adjust the alert settings for that table.

## **External notifications**

By default, alerts appear inside the `Table alerts` panel. You can also receive them externally:

### **Email notifications**

1.  Open the `Table alerts` panel.
2.  Click the **🔔 bell icon** in the panel header to subscribe.
3.  Choose your notification frequency:
    -   **Immediately** (default) — receive an email every time a new alert triggers
    -   **Daily digest** — receive a single email per day with all alerts from that table
    -   **Weekly digest** — receive a weekly summary of all alerts
4.  You'll receive emails to your Clay account-associated email address based on your selected frequency.

### **Slack notifications**

1.  Go to your `Workspace Settings`.
2.  Connect your Slack workspace to Clay's delivery system (workspace admin access required).
3.  Return to the `Table alerts` panel.
4.  Click `Connect Channel`.
5.  Select the Slack channel where you want to receive alerts.
6.  Choose your notification frequency:
    -   **Immediately** (default) — alerts sent to Slack as they trigger
    -   **Daily digest** — a single message per day with all alerts
    -   **Weekly digest** — a weekly summary of all alerts

## **FAQs**

### **How do I get more or fewer alerts?**

Open the `Table alerts` panel and click the **⚙️** icon in the header to access `Alert settings`. Lowering the thresholds means alerts fire more frequently; raising them means fewer alerts fire. The defaults — 90% for column failure rate and 45,000 rows for row count limit — work well as a starting point for most workflows.

### **Are thresholds set per-table or per-workbook?**

Thresholds are configured at the **table level**, giving you individual control over thresholds and alert types for each table. Open the `Table alerts` panel for any table and click the **⚙️** icon to view or update its settings.

### **What is the data inactivity alert?**

The data inactivity alert fires when a table that has recurring data activity — a signal, scheduled signal, or scheduled run — stops receiving new data for a configured period. The default threshold is 3 days. This alert only applies to tables with recurring activity enabled; it won't fire for tables that were never regularly receiving data.

### **How often can the same alert fire?**

Alerts of the same type are rate-limited to once every 24 hours per table, so you won't receive repeated notifications in quick succession for the same condition.

### **Can I subscribe a teammate to email alerts instead of myself?**

Email alerts are tied to the Clay account of the person who clicks the **🔔 bell icon** to subscribe. Each user manages their own subscription individually.

### **What counts as a column error for the column failure rate alert?**

A column error is triggered by failures during action runs, such as missing required inputs, data validation errors, or action pre-validation failures. The alert fires when the percentage of failed runs in a column exceeds your configured threshold.

### **Do resolved alerts come back if the issue isn't fixed?**

Yes. Marking an alert as resolved clears it from your active feed, but if the underlying condition persists or recurs, a new alert will fire.

### **Does the feature cost credits?**

No, table alerts is a monitoring feature and does not consume actions or data credits.
