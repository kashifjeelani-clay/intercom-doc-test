# Plans & billing

We'll walk through each of our pricing plans and information around billing your workspace.

Clay offers plan tiers that differ by features, capacity, and pricing. For a detailed comparison of all plans, visit our [pricing page](https://www.clay.com/pricing).

You can adjust your yearly or monthly credit limits on most plans to match your usage needs, either during sign-up or by contacting our team.

## Understanding actions and data credits

-   **Actions** measure the orchestration you do in Clay: enriching data, running AI research, and sending data to other tools (like posting to Slack or generating Notion briefs). Each enrichment or execution task consumes 1 action. Each action costs a few tenths of a penny. Actions are a background meter included in your Clay plan. 90% of customers will never hit their actions limit.
-   **Data credits:** Used to buy data or AI from 3rd-party vendors in Clay's data marketplace—costs vary by data type. Each credit costs a few pennies.

This separation gives you transparency and control over exactly what you're paying for.

### AI usage

Every AI prompt counts as **one action**. Data credits are consumed based on the model you select—Clay offers both fixed and variable AI pricing. For details on how AI pricing works, see our guide on [how AI is priced](https://university.clay.com/docs/ai-pricing).

For more details on actions and data credits, see our comprehensive guide on [actions and data credits](https://www.clay.com/university/guide/actions-and-data-credits).

## **Upgrade your plan**

To upgrade your Clay workspace plan:

1.  Click your profile picture in the top-right corner and select `Settings`.
2.  In the left sidebar, navigate to `Plans & billing`, then click `Switch plan`.
3.  Select the plan you want to upgrade to and review the details.
4.  Confirm your selection by clicking `Review change → Continue to payment`.

Your new plan will activate immediately, and any applicable charges will be applied.

**How upgrade billing works:** Plan upgrades are **not prorated** — you pay the full price of the new tier immediately, not a partial amount for remaining days in your current cycle. In return, you receive the **full** Actions and Data Credits for your new plan right away. Unused Actions from your previous plan are not carried over (Actions reset each billing cycle and do not roll over). Your existing unused Data Credits are preserved when you upgrade.

### Free plan

-   **Best for:** Exploring the platform and experimenting with small-scale workflows
-   **Data credits:** 100 per month (rollover cap: 200 credits)
-   **Monthly pricing:** $0
-   **Table limit:** 200 rows per table
-   **Key limitations:**
    -   Source record limit: up to **100 records total** per source across all runs (compared to 15,000+ on paid plans). Once a source reaches this limit, it stops adding new records — create a new source to continue.
    -   Scheduled source runs are not available
    -   Phone number enrichments are not available (see [Trials](#trials) for details)
    -   CRM integrations (e.g., HubSpot, Salesforce, Pipedrive) require Growth plan or higher
    -   Email sequencing tools (e.g., Outreach, Salesloft) require Launch plan or higher
    -   HTTP API and webhooks require Growth plan or higher
    -   Custom API keys for certain third-party providers require a paid plan; the Free plan uses Clay-managed accounts for those providers

When your 14-day trial ends, your workspace automatically moves to the Free plan — you won't be charged unless you upgrade. See [Trials](#trials) for what happens to your trial data credits at that point.

### Launch plan

-   **Best for:** Teams enriching less than 1,000 records per month
-   **Actions:** 15,000 per month
-   **Data credits:** 2,500 to 10,000 per month
-   **Monthly pricing:** Starting at $185/month (includes 2,500 credits and 15,000 actions)
-   **Table limit:** 50,000 rows per table
-   **Features:** Basic enrichment, list building, custom API keys for data enrichment integrations

### Growth plan

-   **Best for:** Teams enriching 1,000 to 10,000 records per month
-   **Actions:** 40,000 per month
-   **Data credits:** 6,000 to 100,000 per month
-   **Monthly pricing:** Starting at $495/month (includes 6,000 credits and 40,000 actions)

### Enterprise plan

-   **Best for:** Teams enriching 10,000+ records per month
-   **Actions:** 100,000+ per month (custom)
-   **Data credits:** 100,000+ per month (custom)
-   **Table limit:** 50,000 rows per standard table (this limit applies by default and is not automatically removed on Enterprise); use [bulk enrichment](incorrect_docs/bulk-enrichment.md) to process larger datasets — rows are enriched in rolling batches and sent to your destination with no cumulative row cap
-   **Benefits:** Volume discounts on data credits at higher tiers, dedicated Growth Strategist, managed onboarding, data warehouse integrations, bulk enrichment, SSO, RBAC

### Downgrade your plan

To downgrade your Clay workspace plan:

1.  Click your profile picture in the top-right corner, then select `Settings`.
2.  Navigate to `Plans & billing` and click `Switch plan`.
3.  Choose the plan you'd like to downgrade to and confirm your selection.

**How downgrade billing works:** Plan downgrades are deferred to the end of your current billing cycle — your existing plan stays active until then, and you keep receiving its current Actions and Data Credit allocation. At renewal, your workspace switches to the new plan and your monthly Actions and Data Credit allocation resets to the new plan's level.

**What happens to your Data Credits:** When the plan change takes effect, your credit balance is reduced to the rollover cap of your new plan — 2× its monthly credit limit. For the free plan (100 credits/month), that cap is 200 credits. Any credits above the cap are forfeited. If you have a large balance, spend it down before the change takes effect.

### Cancel your plan

Clay subscriptions **auto-renew by default** — if you do not cancel before your renewal date, your plan renews and you are billed for the next period.

To cancel your Clay subscription:

1.  Click your profile picture in the top-right corner and select `Settings`.
2.  Navigate to `Plan & billing`.
3.  Click the `Plan options` dropdown and select `Cancel plan`.

**How cancellation billing works:** Cancellation takes effect at the end of your current billing cycle. Your plan remains active — with full feature access and credit allocation — until the cycle ends. At that point, your workspace moves to the free plan.

**What happens to your Data Credits:** Your credit balance is capped at the free plan's rollover limit — 200 credits. Any credits above 200 are forfeited. If you have a large balance, spend it down before the cancellation takes effect.

**What happens to your tables and data:** Cancelling does not delete your tables or the data you've previously enriched — everything in your workspace remains visible. Your saved connections and credentials are preserved as well. However, connections that require a paid plan — such as CRM integrations (e.g., HubSpot, Salesforce) and certain provider-specific API keys — cannot be used to run enrichments on the free plan. They become available again when you upgrade to a plan that includes those features.

To request a refund for a recent charge, contact [Clay support](https://app.clay.com). For refund timing, see the FAQs section below.

## Billing

To update your billing address, payment method, or billing email:

1.  Click your profile picture in the top-right corner and select `Settings`.
2.  In the sidebar, navigate to `Plans & billing`.
3.  Click the `Edit` dropdown.
    -   Select `Edit billing info...` to update your name, billing email, country, address, and postal code.
    -   Select `Edit payment method...` to update your credit card or payment method.
4.  Enter the updated information and confirm your changes.

### Trials

Clay offers a 14-day free trial with 1,000 data credits, giving you access to webhooks, CRM integrations, email sequencers, and HTTP API capabilities.

Phone number enrichments aren't available on free or trial plans — this restriction applies even if you have unused data credits. To access this feature, upgrade to a paid plan. This also affects some waterfall templates: if a waterfall includes a provider that can return phone numbers (such as PDL or Bytemine), free and trial users will see "Your subscription does not allow this integration to be added" even if the goal of the waterfall is something other than a phone number (for example, a profile URL). To work around this, remove the phone-number providers from the waterfall sequence. See [Waterfalls](https://university.clay.com/docs/building-a-data-waterfall) for details.

If phone number enrichment doesn't appear immediately after upgrading, refresh the page and re-add the phone-number enrichment column to reload the available providers.

If your team wants to do a trial, each team member can create their own trial account to explore Clay independently.

Trial tables can hold up to **1,000 rows each**. The table view also displays only the first **50 rows** — rows beyond that are blurred in the UI until you upgrade to a paid plan. When you export to CSV, only these first 50 rows are included in the download. Sending data through third-party integrations (such as Google Sheets) is not subject to this row limit.

When your trial ends, your account automatically moves to the free plan — you won't be charged unless you actively choose to upgrade to a paid plan. Clay does not auto-upgrade you. For details on what happens to your trial data credits at that point, see [Actions and data credits](actions-data-credits.md).

**Trial extension:** Clay offers a one-time self-serve extension for workspaces on a trial or free plan. While logged in, visit [https://app.clay.com/extend-my-trial/](https://app.clay.com/extend-my-trial/) to add 14 more days to your trial. If your workspace doesn't immediately reflect the extension, refresh your browser. Each workspace can use this self-serve extension once — if you've already used it and need additional time, contact [Clay support](https://app.clay.com).

## FAQs

### How do I track my actions and data credits usage?

You can track both actions and data credits usage in the `Usage Dashboard`, which you can access from the `Settings` menu in the app. You can also track usage at the table level via `Table history`.

### Do credits roll over?

**Monthly plans:** When your plan refreshes, unused data credits will roll over and accumulate. The maximum accumulation is capped at 2× your plan's monthly credit limit — and this cap includes the newly added renewal credits. For example, if your plan includes 50,000 credits per month, your maximum balance is 100,000. If you already have 82,000 credits when your plan renews, you will end up with 100,000 credits, not 132,000.

**Annual plans:** When your plan refreshes, you can roll over up to 15% of your annual data credits in addition to the new credits you receive, provided you renew on the same or a higher-tier plan.

**If you cancel or downgrade your plan:** When the plan change takes effect, your Data Credit balance is reduced to the rollover cap of your new plan — 2× that plan's monthly credit limit. For example, canceling to the free plan (100 credits/month) caps your balance at 200 credits; any credits above 200 are forfeited. You can continue spending your existing credits up until the plan change takes effect.

For more details, see our guide on [actions and data credits](https://www.notion.so/Actions-and-data-credits-2a77e66eb01480b798f2ddca99d45e80?pvs=21).

### Is upgrading my plan prorated?

No. Plan upgrades are not prorated. When you upgrade to a higher tier, you are charged the full price for the new plan immediately — not a partial amount for remaining days in your current billing cycle. In return, you receive the **full** Actions and Data Credits for your new tier right away, not just the incremental difference over your current plan.

Unused Actions from your previous plan are not refunded or carried over (Actions reset each billing cycle and do not roll over). Your existing unused Data Credits are preserved when you upgrade.

Upgrading also resets your billing cycle to the date of the upgrade — for example, if you upgrade on the 15th, your plan will renew on the 15th of the following month.

If you're unsure whether you need a higher tier, check your current usage in `Settings` → `Usage` to see how many Actions and Data Credits you've consumed this billing cycle before committing to an upgrade.

### What if I need more actions or data credits?

**Actions:** Actions cannot be purchased as one-time top-ups — they represent fixed platform capacity tied to your action tier. To increase your Actions limit, you must upgrade to a higher action tier in `Settings` → `Plans & billing`.

**Data Credits:** You have two options:

-   **Upgrade your Data Credits tier** (recommended for ongoing needs) — no premium charged.
-   **Purchase a one-time top-up** — available on paid plans only; not available on the free plan. For emergency needs during your billing cycle at a 30% premium (50% on legacy plans), subject to rollover limits. Go to `Settings` → `Usage` and click `Add one-time data credits`.

### How many actions and data credits do I need?

-   **Launch plan:** Suitable for enriching less than 1,000 records per month
-   **Growth plan:** Suitable for enriching 1,000 to 10,000 records per month
-   **Enterprise plan:** Suitable for enriching 10,000+ records per month

Each fully enriched record typically costs 6-20 data credits (including company and person profile, email, phone number, and custom AI enrichments). The more private API keys you use, the fewer data credits you'll spend per record.

### How do I cancel my subscription?

There is no minimum contract commitment — you can cancel at any time. To cancel:

1.  Click your profile picture in the top-right corner and select `Settings`.
2.  Navigate to `Plans & billing`.
3.  Click `Cancel plan` and follow the prompts to confirm.

Cancellations take effect at the end of your current billing cycle. Until then, you retain access to your paid plan's features and credit allocation. At the end of the cycle, your workspace moves to the Free plan and your Data Credit balance is reduced to the Free plan's rollover cap (200 credits — see [Do credits roll over?](#do-credits-roll-over) for how the credit cap works). Any credits above that cap are forfeited.

Your tables and previously enriched data are not deleted when you cancel — see [Cancel your plan](#cancel-your-plan) for details on what changes.

For information on payment refunds after canceling, see [How long does a refund take?](#how-long-does-a-refund-take) below.

### How long does a refund take?

Payment refunds take up to **10 business days** to appear in your account after Clay initiates them. If 10 business days have passed and the refund still hasn't appeared:

1.  Confirm the funds haven't already been credited to your account.
2.  Contact [Clay support](https://app.clay.com) and share any available transaction details — an Acquirer Reference Number (ARN) is especially helpful for tracing the payment.

Clay Data Credit refunds (for enrichment actions that return no data) are applied to your account balance immediately after processing.

### Why might my payment fail?

Several common issues can prevent a payment from going through:

-   **Card issuer block:** Your card issuer may flag or decline the transaction due to security concerns. Contact your card issuer to authorize the charge, or try a different payment method.
-   **3D Secure authentication:** Some cards require an additional authentication step when completing a purchase. If you don't complete this step when prompted, the payment won't process. Retry the payment and complete the 3D Secure prompt when it appears, or try a card that doesn't require it.
-   **Card velocity limit:** If your card has been charged too frequently in a short window, your card provider may block further charges. Wait before retrying, or contact your card provider to increase or reset the limit.
-   **Mismatched card details:** Even after updating your payment method, the details you entered may not match what's on file with your card issuer. Double-check the information you entered under `Settings` → `Plans & billing` and verify with your issuer if the problem persists.

If your payment continues to fail after addressing these issues, contact [Clay support](https://app.clay.com).

### What happens if my payment fails?

If a payment fails, Clay retries the charge automatically before canceling your subscription:

-   **Credit card billing (Launch, Growth):** Clay retries for up to **14 days**. If the payment is not resolved within that window, your workspace is downgraded to the Free plan.
-   **Invoice billing (Enterprise):** Clay retries for up to **30 days** before canceling.

Once downgraded to the Free plan, your Data Credit balance is capped at **200 credits** (the Free plan's rollover limit) — any credits above that cap are forfeited at the end of your billing cycle.

To avoid an interruption, keep your payment information current in `Settings` → `Plan & billing`.

### Why was my account locked?

Clay automatically flags accounts suspected of fraud or abuse of free trial credits. If your account has been locked, you'll see a message on the sign-in screen indicating your account has been temporarily locked for fraud protection.

To request a review and have your account unlocked, email [verification@clay.com](mailto:verification@clay.com).

### Why am I being charged sales tax?

For customers in the United States, Clay is required to charge and collect taxes in jurisdictions that have laws taxing our products and where Clay has either a physical presence or has met certain economic thresholds — such as sales volume or number of customers in a region. These taxes vary by jurisdiction and include sales taxes and excise or privilege taxes.

If you are in a US jurisdiction where Clay's products are taxable but Clay has not yet established a presence or met the relevant thresholds, no sales tax will be charged — though this may change as Clay continues to grow and establish a presence in additional states.

As Clay's revenue grows, it establishes a tax nexus in additional states. A tax nexus means Clay has a sufficient business presence in a state — based on sales volume, customers, or other economic thresholds — that requires it to collect and remit sales tax. If you were a customer before Clay started collecting sales tax in your state, Clay has accounted for any prior tax obligations on your behalf.

### What address does Clay use to calculate my sales tax?

Clay uses the shipping address saved on your account to determine your tax jurisdiction. If no shipping address is on file, it falls back to the billing address saved on your account.

Sales tax is calculated based on the taxability of the products you purchased, your address on file, and the tax rate of the applicable jurisdiction. To update your address, contact [support@clay.com](mailto:support@clay.com).

### What if my business is tax-exempt?

Certain organizations — such as non-profits and educational institutions — may qualify for sales tax exemptions. If your organization has an exemption certificate, contact [support@clay.com](mailto:support@clay.com) and provide a copy of the certificate.
