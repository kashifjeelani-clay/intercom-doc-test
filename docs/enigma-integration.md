## FAQs

### What businesses does Enigma cover?

Enigma's data covers U.S. businesses only. Address fields (street address, city, state, ZIP code) only support U.S. addresses when used as lookup filters.

### Do I need a paid Enigma account to use this integration?

Yes. An active Enigma account with API access is required. You can request access and retrieve your API key from the [Enigma console](https://console.enigma.com/).

### Can I use a company name instead of a domain?

Yes. For most Enigma actions, either a company domain or a company name is sufficient to run the enrichment. Providing both, or adding optional address fields, can help improve match accuracy for companies with common names or multiple locations.

### Why do some actions return a "Projected Quantity" output?

Enigma's card transaction metrics (revenue, growth rate, transaction count, and transaction size) are derived from a large anonymized panel of credit and debit card data and are modeled estimates, not exact figures reported by the business.
