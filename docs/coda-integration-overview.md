# Coda integration overview

All-in-one workspace for team collaboration.

## Coda Overview

The Coda integration lets you sync data within your Clay table with your Coda bases. With this integration you’re able to:

-   Lookup Row
-   Create or Upsert Row

## Setting up Coda and Clay

To get set up, you’ll need to add your Coda account to Clay from either the enrichment panel or the **Settings > Connections** page.

You’ll add your account by entering your API token which can be obtained from [_My account_](https://coda.io/account) in Coda.

Make sure your linked Coda account has the right level of access to the tables you want to connect with Clay.
