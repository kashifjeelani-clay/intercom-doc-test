Lusha is a B2B sales intelligence platform that provides verified contact and company data, including work emails, phone numbers, and buying signals.

## **FAQs**

**Can I use multiple types of inputs to find company or person lookalikes?**

Yes! Both `Find company lookalikes` and `Find people lookalikes` support combining multiple types of inputs, whether domains, professional profile URLs, or emails. When finding person lookalikes using first name and last name, you must also include a company domain or company name to help match the correct contact.

**Will I get duplicate companies when aggregating lookalike results from multiple seed companies?**

Yes, some overlap is expected. When lookalike searches are run across multiple seed companies — whether in a single batch or across multiple runs — the same company can appear as a match for more than one seed. There is no way to filter out these duplicates upfront.

The recommended approach is to send your results into a separate destination table and enable auto-dedupe on a unique identifier column such as company domain. Open the destination table's name dropdown → `Edit table settings` → enable **Auto-dedupe rows**, select the column to match on, and choose whether to keep the **oldest** or **newest** row. See [Table management settings](table-management-settings.md) for setup details.

**What happens if I toggle on additional datapoints in Enrich Person?**

Turning on additional data points, like email and phone, will consume Lusha Unified Credits from your Lusha account. Emails deduct 1 credit per contact, while phone numbers deduct 5 credits per contact.

**Are Lusha's signals actions always-on monitors?**

No. Lusha's signals actions (`Enrich person signals`, `Enrich company headcount growth`, `Enrich company jobs growth`, and `Enrich company news`) are retroactive lookups, not always-on monitors like Clay's native Signals. These actions check for events that occurred within a specified lookback window, but they won't notify you of future events as they happen.
