# Message drafting overview

Write personalized message sequences with AI, conditionals and more.

## Message drafting overview

The **Message drafting** feature streamlines the process of creating personalized, dynamic messages for export to your chosen sequencer.

This is particularly useful for automating outbound campaigns, such as sales outreach, as well as creating personalized intake messages for signups.

## Steps to using the message drafting feature

**Step 1: Open message drafting feature**

Access the message drafting tool through the export menu: **Tools > Export > Export Messages to Sequencer**.

**Step 2: Select your sequencer**

Choose the sequencer you want to export your messages to from the list.

**Note:** Each sequencer has unique export requirements and settings. For details, refer to the notes on sequencer-specific settings below.

**Step 3: Write your message(s)**

Within the **Message Drafting Panel**, craft your messages.

Be mindful of your sequencer's export settings to ensure compatibility.

**Step 4: Configure field mappings**

Click **Continue** to review and verify the field mappings for custom fields with your sequencer.

**Tip:** Some sequencers require fields to be pre-configured, while others allow you to create fields directly from within the action.

**Step 5: Verify run settings and run the enrichment**

Check your auto-update and conditional run-settings, as well as any other setting within your action to verify exporting.

## Message drafting panel components

The **Message Drafting Panel** is composed of several key components that work together to help you create dynamic, personalized messages efficiently.

### **Subject line**

-   Enter your desired subject line in the **Subject** field.

### **Message body**

-   Write your message directly in the **Body** field.
-   Use **AI Snippets** to generate suggestions or enhance your content.
-   Add **Conditional Snippets** to include dynamic content based on specific conditions, such as field values or logical operators.

### **AI model and account settings**:

-   Select the desired AI model for drafting (e.g., gpt-4o-mini).
-   Ensure the correct account is connected to access the AI functionality.

### **Run action settings**

-   Toggle **Auto-update** to refresh message drafts automatically with updated data.
-   Configure the **Only Run If** condition to control when the action should execute (e.g., only if a specific field exists).

## **AI Snippets**

Create dynamic, tailored content directly within your message drafter using AI snippets.

## **Conditional snippets**

Conditional Snippets allow you to add dynamic logic to your messages, displaying specific content based on defined conditions.

### **Key Features**

-   [**Conditional Logic**](https://www.clay.com/university/guide/conditional-statements): Define "if/else" conditions to display different content based on recipient-specific data, such as including a personalized greeting if a first name exists.
-   [**Logical Operators**](https://www.clay.com/university/guide/logical-operators): Combine multiple conditions using operators like AND (e.g., First Name exists AND Company Name does not include "Clay") or OR.
-   [**Comparison Operators**](https://www.clay.com/university/guide/comparison-operators): Compare data values (e.g., check if a field "equals," "does not equal," or "contains" specific information) to tailor your message logic.
-   **Custom Fields**: Insert dynamic fields from your data for tailored messaging.

### **How to Use Conditional Snippets**

1.  **Insert a Conditional Snippet**:
    -   In your message body, type `/` to open the conditional snippet panel.
2.  **Define Your Conditions**:
    -   Use the **Where** fields to set conditions based on your data.
    -   Add multiple conditions using **AND** or **OR** to refine your logic branches.
    -   Example: Check if a field (`First Name`) exists or if another field (`Company Name`) contains specific text.
3.  **Set the "If" Output**:
    -   Define the content that will appear if the conditions are met.
    -   Use placeholders to dynamically insert data (e.g., `Hey {{First Name}}`,).
4.  **Set the "Else" Output**:
    -   Provide fallback content for cases where the conditions aren't met (e.g., `Hey there`).
5.  **Save and Test**:
    -   Save your snippet and test it with sample data to verify that the correct content displays for both "if" and "else" scenarios.
