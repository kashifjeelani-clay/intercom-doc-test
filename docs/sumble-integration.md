# Sumble integration

Validate whether a company uses specific technologies.

Sumble enables efficient verification of company technology usage by analyzing signals across jobs, people, and teams.

With this integration, you can validate whether a company uses specific technologies, enrich your ICP segments, and strengthen sales and marketing workflows that rely on accurate tech stack insights.

## **Enriching data with Sumble**

1.  While in a Clay table, click `Add enrichment` and search for `Sumble`.
