# Find People in Clay

Discover relevant contacts matching your criteria within Clay's database.

The `Find People` source helps you search for people using criteria like job title, company, location, and experience.

This tool is ideal for building targeted sales prospect lists, identifying potential hires, and conducting market research.

**Note:** You can get up to 500 results per cell by reducing the data you're requesting. Click the column name and select **Edit column → Reduce Data for More Results**.

## **Creating a table with Find People**

1.  In a workbook, click `+ Add` at the bottom.
2.  Search for `Find People`.

**Note:** The search wizard shows a preview of up to 50 results so you can check your criteria before importing. When you click **Import**, all matching results — up to the **Limit results** value you configure — are added to the table.

## Adding more profiles to an existing people table

To add more profiles from the same search to an existing people table without creating a new table:

1.  In your people table, click **+ Add** at the bottom and select **Find more people**.
2.  Choose the existing search whose results you want to expand.
3.  Enter the number of additional profiles to import in the **Number of profiles to add** field. The modal shows how many profiles have already been imported from that search and how many are still available.
4.  Click **Add people**.

**Note:** Each Find People source has a cumulative profile limit that varies by billing plan. The modal displays your plan's maximum and the number of profiles still available in the selected search. See [your source has exceeded your plan's limit](finding-companies-and-people-in-clay.md#your-source-has-exceeded-your-plans-limit-error-on-find-companies-or-find-people) for troubleshooting.

## `Source` **Find People**

**Inputs:**

-   **Company attributes:** Filter by company size, industry (include or exclude), and description keywords to narrow your search.
-   **Job title:** Filter by organizational level, function, or specific titles (e.g., CEO, VP). Results include synonyms, similar titles, and translated titles. For example, searching "Software Developer" returns results like "Frontend Engineer" and "Ingénieur logiciel."
    -   **Job title must contain exact:** Each result must contain at least one of your search terms, ignoring capitalization and special characters. Synonyms and similar titles are excluded. For example, "Founder/CEO" matches "ceo", but "Frontend Engineer" does not match "Software Developer."
    -   **Job title must match exactly:** Each result must match at least one search term exactly, including capitalization. Special characters are not allowed. For example, neither "Founder/CEO" nor "ceo" will match "CEO."
    -   **Exact phrase matching:** Wrap multi-word terms in quotes to search for exact phrases. For example, "Google Cloud" finds profiles with that specific expertise. Note: Special characters (#, +, !) and stopwords ('a', 'an', 'of', 'the') are removed.
-   **Experience:** Filter by current role duration, number of positions held, and keywords in experience descriptions. The Experience section contains three sub-filters in the standard search UI, with a fourth available in Advanced Search (see note below):
    -   **Months in current role:** Set a minimum and/or maximum number of months a person has been in their current position.
    -   **Number of experiences:** Set a minimum and/or maximum count of separate job entries listed on a person's profile. **This counts individual roles, not total years of career experience.** For example, setting Max = 2 returns people with two or fewer job entries, which is a useful proxy for early-career candidates. To approximate total career experience without a direct filter, combine this with a cap on **Months in current role**, or import results and use a **Use AI** column to analyze each person's full work history.
    -   **Experience description keywords:** Return only people whose experience descriptions include specific keywords (e.g., "construction", "machine learning").
    -   **Years of experience** *(Advanced Search — currently in closed beta):* Set a minimum and/or maximum number of estimated full-time years of experience based on the person's profile. This filter is part of the Advanced Search (Search DSL) mode. Contact support to request access to the closed beta.
-   **Location:** Include or exclude specific regions, countries, or cities. Distance-based filtering (for example, "within 35 miles of a location") is not available — location filters accept named regions, countries, and cities only.
-   **Profile:** Filter by names, connection count, or follower count ranges.
    -   **Bio keywords:** Return only people whose profile mentions at least one of your keywords (searches across headline, bio, experience descriptions, and languages). Multiple keywords use OR logic — entering `Python, CPA` returns profiles mentioning either term, not only profiles that mention both.
-   **Certifications:** Search for specific certifications (e.g., AWS, Google Cloud).
-   **Languages:** Filter by specific languages spoken.
-   **Education:** Search for specific school names.
-   **Companies:** Find people at specific companies using an existing Clay table or a custom list. By default, this matches people who **currently** work at those companies.
    -   **Locked after creation:** The filter type (Clay table vs. custom list) and which table is linked cannot be changed once the source exists — this is what the "Can only be changed during source creation" tooltip means. The table's row contents are not frozen, however: adding or removing rows from the linked table is reflected each time the source runs. When re-run after new companies are added, the source searches across all companies currently in the table, not just the newly added ones.
    -   **Run settings:** The source runs **Manually** by default — adding new companies to the linked table does not automatically trigger a new run. To automatically pick up new companies on a recurring basis, click the source column header in your people table, expand **Run settings**, and switch from **Manually** to **On a schedule**. Choose a frequency (Daily is most common) and click **Save schedule**. You can also click **Run now** at any time for an immediate on-demand run.
    -   **Company identifier type:** The identifier in your linked table or custom list determines how companies are resolved. **Domains** (e.g., `acme.com`) match at the root-domain level — useful for broader coverage, but may return people from a parent company or other entities that share that domain. **Company profile URLs** from the professional network match the exact company page, limiting results to that specific entity. Company profile URLs return fewer but more precise results; domains return more but may include unintended companies.
-   **Exclude people:** Exclude up to 3 different sets of people from your search using Clay tables, CSVs, or manual lists. You can exclude up to 300,000 people total (100,000 per source). Exclusions match by individual professional profile URL — each row in your exclusion table must contain a person-level profile URL. Adding a company name, domain, or company page URL to the exclusion table will **not** suppress all people from that company.

    **To exclude all people at a specific company**, use a post-import lookup instead: after importing your Find People results, add a **Lookup single row in other table** action that matches each person's company domain against your company blocklist. Set a run condition on downstream enrichments (for example, `{{Company Blocklist Lookup}} is not empty` → skip) to suppress anyone whose employer appears on your list. See [Excluding records during enrichment](finding-companies-and-people-in-clay.md#excluding-records-during-enrichment) for the full pattern.
-   **Past experiences:** Enable the **Include past experiences** toggle to extend your company, job title, and experience description keyword filters to also match against a person's past roles — not just their current one.
    -   **Incompatible filters:** This toggle cannot be combined with **Limit per company** or any **Company attributes** filter (company size, company industries, or company description keywords). Selecting them together returns an error.
    -   **May return fewer results when enabled:** Because exclude keywords apply to a person's entire work history when this toggle is on, the result count can decrease rather than increase. For example, if "Manager" is an excluded title, anyone who has ever held a role containing that word is filtered out — not just people whose current role matches.
-   **Limit results:** Set a maximum number of results per search (up to 50,000 records).
-   **Limit per company:** Set the maximum number of people to return per company (up to 100). Note: the preview count shown before running the search reflects the total match universe across all companies and does not account for this limit — the actual number of imported rows will be lower.

**Note:** If a Find People search with **Limit per company** configured imports fewer rows than you expect from a large company list, re-running the source triggers a full import. Re-open the source configuration (click the source and select **Edit**), make any minor change, and re-run — or create a new table with the same search settings. Either approach returns all matching results.

**Note:** If you delete rows that were previously imported by a Find People source and then re-run the source, those contacts will not be re-imported. The source tracks all previously returned results in an internal exclusion list; re-runs skip anyone already seen, regardless of whether their row was later deleted from the table. To retrieve the same contacts, create a new table with the same search settings — this starts with a fresh exclusion list.

**Note:** Deleting rows from a Find People table — including rows removed automatically by auto-delete — does not reset the per-company limit counter. If a company has already reached its **Limit per company** cap, the source will not import additional contacts from that company on future runs, even after those rows are deleted. The source tracks how many contacts have been processed per company independently of what rows currently exist in the table. To get additional contacts from companies that have already hit their limit, create a new table with the same search settings.

**Outputs:**

Each result includes a **Structured Location** object in the cell details with geocoded, normalized fields — so you don't need additional AI columns to parse or reformat location data. These fields work with informal location names like "Greater Chicago Area."

-   **City**
-   **State**
-   **Region**
-   **Country**
-   **Country Iso**

## Enriching your results

**Note on data freshness:** Find People results come from a periodically refreshed index — not a live LinkedIn lookup at search time. A person's job title or company in the results may not reflect their most recent LinkedIn update. To get current employment data, run **Enrich Person** after importing — this fetches the live profile and returns the most up-to-date job title and company information.

After importing Find People results, use Clay's enrichments to add contact information such as work email and mobile phone numbers.

**Work email:** In your table, click `Add enrichment` and select `Work Email`. This pre-built waterfall searches multiple email providers in sequence. For full setup details, including how credits are charged across providers, see [Work Email waterfall](work-email-waterfall.md).

**Mobile phone:** To find mobile phone numbers, click `Add enrichment`, search for `Phone number`, and select the waterfall option under **Waterfalls**. The phone number waterfall cascades through multiple providers in sequence — providers that return no result are skipped at no credit cost, so you only pay when a provider finds a number. For provider recommendations by region, see [[Data test] Mobile phone providers by region](data-test-methodology-mobile-phone-region.md).

## FAQs

### Does importing from Find People cost credits?

**No.** Importing people from Clay's database using the Find People source consumes no Data Credits. The same applies to the Find Companies and Find Jobs sources — pulling records from Clay's dataset is free.

Any enrichments you add afterward (work email, phone number, profile enrichment) consume their own Data Credits as usual. Each Find People source also has a cumulative profile limit that varies by billing plan — see [your source has exceeded your plan's limit](finding-companies-and-people-in-clay.md#your-source-has-exceeded-your-plans-limit-error-on-find-companies-or-find-people) for troubleshooting.

### Can I see the total number of people that match my search before importing?

**Yes.** The search wizard shows a result count directly in the interface — you can see how many people match your filters before clicking Import. The count also shows how many rows will be imported based on your **Limit results** setting. For very large searches, the count may display as a capped number with a "+" indicator; hover over it to load the full exact total.

## Importing from a Sales Navigator search URL

If you have a saved Sales Navigator search and want to pull those results into Clay, use the **Find people from external search** source — not the standard Find People source described above.

1.  In a workbook, click `+ Add` at the bottom.
2.  Search for `external search`.
3.  Select **Find people from external search**.
4.  Paste your Sales Navigator people search URL (e.g., `https://www.linkedin.com/sales/search/people/...`).
5.  Optionally set a **Max Count** (default and maximum is 2,500 — this is a Sales Navigator limit).
6.  Click **Import to new table**.

**Note:** This source requires a Sales Navigator **people search URL** (`https://www.linkedin.com/sales/search/people/...`), not a saved lead list URL (`linkedin.com/sales/lists/people`) or a saved search URL (those containing `savedSearchId`). If you have a saved Sales Navigator lead list, recreate the equivalent filters as a fresh people search on Sales Navigator and copy that URL instead. Each imported result costs 1 Clay credit.

If the list was manually curated and cannot be recreated from search filters, export it from Sales Navigator as a CSV and [import it into Clay](incorrect_docs/csv-import-overview.md) instead.

If your Sales Navigator search matches more than 2,500 leads, the 2,500 cap is enforced by LinkedIn — there is no way to raise it within a single import. To bring in a larger set, split your search into smaller segments so each stays under the limit. Use any filter dimension to divide the results:

-   **By seniority level** — Run a separate import for each seniority tier (for example, Director+, Manager, Individual Contributor).
-   **By headcount** — Filter by company size to separate results from small, mid-size, and enterprise companies.
-   **By location** — Run separate searches for each country or region.

Collect the resulting Sales Navigator URLs and add them to your Clay table one at a time.

## Finding LinkedIn posts by keyword

To find LinkedIn posts containing a specific keyword or hashtag, use the **Find professional posts** source — a separate source from Find People that returns posts rather than people profiles.

**To create a table with Find professional posts:**

1.  In a workbook, click `+ Add` at the bottom.
2.  Search for `Find professional posts` and select it.

**Inputs:**

-   **Keyword:** A single keyword or hashtag to search for in post content (e.g., `#cvpr2026` or `GTM`). Only one keyword is supported — comma-separated lists are not valid.
-   **Companies filter (optional):** Limit results to posts that mention companies, were posted by companies, or were posted by employees of specific companies.
-   **People filter (optional):** Limit results to posts that mention or were posted by specific individuals.
-   **Sort by:** `Most recent` (default) or `Top match`.
-   **Time frame:** `Last 24 hours` or `Last week` (default).
-   **Max number of results:** Default is 100; maximum is 1,000.

**Outputs:**

Each row includes the post URL, post text, author name, author LinkedIn URL, author title, reaction counts, comment count, and share count.

**To enrich post authors:** After importing results, add an **Enrich Person** column and map it to the author LinkedIn URL. This returns full contact data — work email, company, and more — for each post author.

**To get comments, reactions, or shares on a specific post:** Click `Add enrichment`, search for **Get comments on a professional post**, **Get reactions on a professional post**, or **Get shares on a professional post**, and map **Post URL** to the post URL column from your import.

> **Important:** These actions require the original post URL — a URL containing `-activity-` in the path (e.g., `https://www.linkedin.com/posts/clay-hq_...-activity-7212099008951975937-ezPv`). Share URLs containing `-share-` are not valid and return an error. To get the original URL for any post: open the post on LinkedIn, click **•••** (three dots) at the top right of the post, and select **Copy link to post**. If the post is a repost of someone else's content, open the original underlying post first and copy its link.

## Getting people who interacted with a post

To build a table of people who liked, commented on, or shared a specific post, use the **Get interactions with professional posts** source. Each interaction is included as a separate row, and you choose how duplicate interactions are handled via the required **duplicate interaction behavior** setting:

-   **One row per person globally** (`interactor`): a given person appears at most once across all results.
-   **One row per person per post** (`post-interactor`): a given person appears at most once per post, but can appear across multiple posts.
-   **Include all interactions** (`no-dedupe`): every interaction is returned as its own row, so the same person can appear in many rows.

**To set up this source:**

1.  In a workbook, click `+ Add`.
2.  Search for `Get interactions with professional posts` and select it.
3.  Provide the post URL — either as a manual entry or by linking to a column in an existing Clay table.

**URL format requirement:** This source only accepts `activity` and `ugcPost` type post URLs. Share URLs — those containing `-share-` between the author slug and the post ID — are not valid and return an invalid-URL error. To identify the URL type: valid post URLs contain either `-activity-` or `ugcPost` in the path; share post URLs contain `-share-` and are not accepted.

To get the correct URL: open the post, click **•••** (three dots) at the top right of the post, and choose **Copy link to post**. If the post is a reshare, open the original underlying post first and copy its link from there.

## Getting a person's posts and shares

**Get a person's professional posts and shares** is an enrichment you add to an existing table of people. It fetches that person's most recent professional activity — both original posts and reposts.

**Adding the enrichment:**

1.  In a table with a professional profile URL column, click **Add enrichment**.
2.  Search for `Get a person's professional posts and shares` and select it.
3.  Map **Professional URL** to your profile URL column.
4.  Click **Save**.

**Output structure:**

The enrichment returns a single `posts` array. Each item in that array can be an original post or a repost, distinguished by the `activity_type` field:

-   `activity_type: "post"` — an original post the person authored
-   `activity_type: "share"` — content the person shared from someone else

**Important:** There is no separate `shares` array. Both original posts and reposts are stored together in the same `posts` array.

**Extracting post text:**

For original posts, the text is in `posts[N].text`. For reposts, `posts[N].text` is `null` when the person shared without adding their own comment — in that case, the text of the original content being shared is in `posts[N].shared_post.text`.

> **Note:** Use `shared_post` (snake_case) in formulas. The Cell details panel displays this field as "Shared Post," but formula references must use `shared_post`.

To pull text from all activity — both original posts and reposts — into a single column, add a formula column and paste:

```
{{Get a person's professional posts and shares}}?.posts?.map(p => p.text || p.shared_post?.text || "").filter(Boolean).join("\n")
```

This returns one entry per item, each on its own line, skipping items where no text is available.

**Exporting to CSV:**

CSV export does not include nested JSON from enrichment columns — only a short preview appears in the export. To get the full post text into a CSV:

1.  Add a formula column using the formula above to extract the text into a flat text field.
2.  Export via **Tools → Export → Download CSV**.

**Note:** Formula and text columns have an 8KB cell limit. If a person has many posts, the joined text may exceed this. In that case, create separate columns for individual posts by index — for example:

-   Post 1: `{{Get a person's professional posts and shares}}?.posts?.[0]?.text || {{Get a person's professional posts and shares}}?.posts?.[0]?.shared_post?.text`
-   Post 2: `{{Get a person's professional posts and shares}}?.posts?.[1]?.text || {{Get a person's professional posts and shares}}?.posts?.[1]?.shared_post?.text`

Repeat for as many posts as you need. Each column stays under the 8KB limit. See [Cell size limits](manage-cell-data.md#cell-size-limits) for more detail.

**If the enrichment returns no data or fewer posts than expected:**

This enrichment uses a third-party data provider authenticated with its own credentials — not your professional network session. As a result, the provider may not see all posts that are visible to you when browsing the platform while signed in, and some recent posts can be missed.

If a row returns empty or incomplete results, re-running the enrichment on that row may return more complete data on a subsequent attempt.

For more control over post retrieval, you can connect a tool like Phantombuster or Apify to Clay and run lookups using your own session cookie, which can improve coverage for profiles whose activity is not fully visible to unauthenticated providers.
