# Close integration overview

Streamlined CRM software for team productivity.

## Setting up the Close Integration

To set up the Close and Clay integration, follow these steps:

1.  Visit the Settings page and navigate to **Connections.**
2.  Click **\+ Add Connection** and select Close the menu
3.  Enter your Close API key and name your Account. Reference [Close’s API key guide](https://help.close.com/docs/api-keys-oauth) for more help.

## Import Close contacts into Clay as a source

You can use Close as a source for a new or existing table.

To set up Close as a source:

**Step 1:** Select Close source option.

In a workbook, click `+ Add` at the bottom. Search for `Close` and select from the results.

**Step 2:** Select the Close account you want to use.

**Step 3:** Fill out Auth fields to connect to Close’s database.

## Available Close actions

Within your Clay table and workbook, you’re able to run the following Close-supported actions:

-   Lookup Objects
-   Create Leads
-   Update Leads
-   Create Contact
-   Update Contact
-   Subscribe to Sequence
