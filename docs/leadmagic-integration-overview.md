We'll cover how to connect Clay to LeadMagic, then we'll go over each action that is available with LeadMagic.

But first let's talk a bit about data enrichment waterfalls.

## **Getting better email and phone number coverage with waterfall enrichments**

LeadMagic is great for finding email and phone number contacts, but it's not the only way to get this data.

For better coverage on contact data, we recommend using [Clay's waterfall enrichments](https://www.clay.com/waterfall-enrichment), which will let you search sequentially across multiple data providers.

That said, let's get into it on how to use LeadMagic with Clay!

### **Option 2: Add your own LeadMagic API key**

If you are currently on a paid plan, you can use your own LeadMagic account within Clay through an API key.
