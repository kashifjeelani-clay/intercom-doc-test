# Webflow integration

Create, retrieve, and update items in Webflow from Clay.

Webflow is a powerful no-code website development platform that enables users to create professional, responsive websites without writing any code.

With this integration, you can create, retrieve, and update items in your Webflow collections directly from Clay, enabling seamless data synchronization between platforms.

## **Enriching data with Webflow**

1.  While in a Clay table, click `Add enrichment` and search for `Webflow`.
2.  Under `Integrations`, select one of the Webflow options.
3.  In the modal, you will be asked to `Select Webflow account`.
    -   If you haven't already connected your Webflow account, click `+ Add account` and go through the authentication.

### `Action` Create collection item

Creates a new item in a specified Webflow collection.

**Inputs**

-   **Site**
-   **Collection**
-   **Is draft (Optional):** Check this to create items as drafts.
-   **Is archived (Optional):** Check this to create items as archived.

### `Action` Get collection item

Retrieves a single item from a specified Webflow collection.

**Inputs**

## Best practices & troubleshooting

-   **Publish new fields at least once:** Webflow's API requires a custom field to have a value in a published Collection Item and a site republish before it becomes accessible.
-   **Format slugs correctly:** Slugs must use lowercase letters and hyphens (-) instead of spaces or underscores.
    -   **Correct:** `company-overview`, `summer-sale`, `contact-us`
    -   **Incorrect:** `Company Overview`, `company@2022`, `My_Page!`
-   **Ensure Item ID** comes from a recent `Get collection item` lookup.
-   **Remap all fields** you want to preserve, as any omitted fields will reset to defaults.
-   **Image fields** must use either a direct, CORS-enabled image URL or be uploaded directly to Webflow.
-   **Remove any** control characters and unsupported HTML from ri**ch text/long text** fields.
-   **PlainText fields have a 280-character limit:** Clay enforces a 280-character maximum on PlainText fields when creating or updating collection items. Content exceeding this limit triggers a validation error ("does not meet the required format"). To send longer text, use a RichText field instead.
