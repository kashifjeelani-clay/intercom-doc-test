# Ocean.io integration

Find companies similar to a given company based on various criteria.

> **Removed:** Ocean.io's lookalike enrichments and sources have been removed from Clay. [Clay Lookalikes](incorrect_docs/clay-lookalikes.md) is the recommended replacement — it covers company and people lookalikes natively, with clustering, Sculptor support, and audience-scale inputs. Previously saved Ocean.io sources and enrichments return a deprecation error when triggered — migrate to Clay Lookalikes to restore this functionality.

[Ocean.io](http://Ocean.io) is an AI-powered company discovery platform that helps you find companies and people similar to a given target based on criteria like industry, size, location, and technology. Within Clay, you can use [Ocean.io](http://Ocean.io) to create a new table populated with lookalike companies, or enrich existing rows to find matching companies and people that fit your ICP.
