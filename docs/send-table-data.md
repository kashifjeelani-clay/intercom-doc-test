# Send table data

Send data between tables to create simple multi-table setups.

Send data between tables in Clay lets you route records between tables, making multi-table setups simple to manage and intuitive to use.

**Note:** Send Table Data replaces the deprecated [Write to Other Table](https://university.clay.com/docs/write-to-table-integration-overview) action. If you previously used Write to Other Table, use Send Table Data for all new multi-table workflows going forward.

### When to use Lookup Rows vs. Send Table Data

Both Lookup Rows and Send Table Data move information between tables, but they work in opposite directions and serve different purposes.

**Use Lookup Rows when...**

Lookup Rows **pulls** data from another table into your current table based on matching criteria. It's non-destructive and doesn't modify the source table.

-   You need to **enrich your current table** with data that already exists in another table
-   You want to **check if a record exists** in another table without modifying anything
-   You need to **count or aggregate** rows that share a trait (e.g., how many people work at each company)
-   You want to **reference** data from a central table (like a pricing list, messaging library, or Do Not Contact list)
-   You're working with **static reference data** that multiple tables need to access

**Use Send Table Data when...**

Send Table Data **pushes** data from your current table into another table. It creates or updates rows in the destination table.

-   You need to **route or segment** your data into different tables based on logic or filters
-   You want to **flatten lists** into individual rows (e.g., turn a list of 5 people into 5 separate rows)
-   You need to **merge data** from several tables into one consolidated table
-   You want to **separate concerns** across multiple tables (e.g., companies in one table, people in another)
-   You're building **multi-stage workflows** where each table handles a specific step in your process

## Sending table data

To send data from one table to another:

1.  While in a table, click **+ Add column** at the end of the column headers and select **Send table data** (listed under Exports). You can also reach it by opening the **Exports** tab in the command center sidebar.
2.  Select the destination table.
3.  Choose the method:
    -   `Send row`: Choose which columns to send as a row to the other table.
    -   `Send row for each item in a list`
4.  Select data to send over.
5.  Click `Save`.

### Using `Send row`

`Send row` sends each row as-is to another table. Use it to filter or segment data, or to separate logic across multiple tables. It transfers specific columns, keeping your data aligned and reducing manual entry. Any extracted basic field can be sent to the destination table using the checklist selectors.

**Additionally you can:**

-   Send nested data from the parent table: action columns (enrichments like **Enrich Person** or **Find Contacts at Company**) are not included in the default column checklist — only basic extracted fields appear there. To include an action column's output, scroll to the **Additional data** section in the Send Table Data settings and click **Add field**, then select the action column. After saving, re-run the Send Table Data column; the nested output arrives in the destination table's **"Rows from: …"** cell alongside any basic fields you selected.
-   Map any selected column to a specific existing column in the destination table. By default, each column routes to a destination column with the same name — hover over the row and click the **edit icon** to open a dropdown of all destination columns and choose a different target.

**Note:** When you first send a row, it creates a new row in the destination table. For subsequent sends, it updates that same row. This applies to both regular row data and nested data. You can turn this off to always create a new row via the `Update existing rows on re-run` setting.

### Using `Send row for each item in a list`

Each cell can hold a list of items — like a list of people found at a company, or a list of job postings returned by Find Active Job Openings. To turn each item in that list into its own row in another table, use `Send row for each item in a list`.

This is useful for **flattening lists**. For example, if you run Find Active Job Openings on a list of companies, each cell may contain multiple job postings — use this method to send each posting as its own row in a destination table, giving you a clean per-role breakdown you can filter and analyze. Similarly, if you find multiple people at a company, you can send each person as a separate row. **This method always creates a new row for each item.**

**Note:** This method sends a maximum of **20 items per row** per run. If the list has more than 20 items, only the first 20 will be sent—there is no setting to increase this limit. For workflows that need to process more than 20 items per row, use [Lookup Multiple Rows](https://university.clay.com/docs/lookup-rows) to query the destination table directly instead.

You can also select additional data to send along with the flattened list, just like with `Send row`.

**Tip: Use "Take action on list" to set this up automatically**

The easiest way to configure `Send row for each item in a list` is to use the **Take action on list** shortcut from the cell details panel:

1.  Click on a cell in the column whose list you want to flatten (for example, a "Find Active Job Openings" or "Find Contacts at Company" result cell).
2.  In the Cell details panel, hover over the list section (e.g., "People") to reveal the **Take action on list** button.
3.  Select **Write each item to new row in other table**.

This opens the Send Table Data configuration with the correct list field already pre-populated — so you don't need to manually identify which field to use as the list source.

**Selecting the right list field manually**

The list input shows a **"Type / to insert column"** placeholder when no column has been selected. Click in the field, type `/`, and pick the column that holds your array data (for example, `Job Openings` or `Contacts`). **If you save without selecting a column, the column will run but fail at runtime with `Invalid send table data inputs … "listData" … "Required"`** — meaning Clay has no list to iterate over.

When configuring the list field by hand, select the **list itself** (e.g., `People`), not an indexed element from within that list (e.g., `People.0`, which is just the first person). When you hover over an array-type column in the token picker, you'll see an **Insert all items** option — click it to insert the full list rather than a single indexed element. Selecting a single indexed element instead of the whole array is a common source of confusion: the configuration will show a **"Please add a valid list."** error because an indexed element isn't recognized as a list.

**If the column holds a stringified JSON array** — for example, a text value that looks like `[{"name": "Alice"}, {"name": "Bob"}]`, common when data arrives from an HTTP API call or webhook — Clay won't recognize it as a native list and will show the same **"Please add a valid list."** error. To fix this, click the **gear icon** on the right side of the list input to switch to formula mode, then enter `JSON.parse(/YourColumn)`, replacing `YourColumn` with the name of your column (use `/` to reference it). This converts the text string into a native array that Clay can iterate over.

If your table has no rows with data yet, Clay skips this validation and accepts the formula as-is. In that case, run a few rows first so the enrichment column has real output, then re-open the Send Table Data configuration to confirm the list field is valid before running the full table.

### Routing data conditionally with multiple Send table data columns

You can add more than one Send table data column to the same source table. Each column can target the same destination table or a different one, and each can have its own **run condition** — so rows take different paths depending on conditions in your data.

**Example: branch based on how many contacts were found**

A common pattern with people-finding enrichments is to route contacts down one of two paths depending on how many were returned per company:

-   **When few contacts are found (e.g., fewer than 3):** A "Send table data" column with a run condition like `{{Find Contacts at Company}}?.peopleCount < 3` sends the raw `People` list directly to the destination table using **Send row for each item in a list**.
-   **When many contacts are found (e.g., 3 or more):** A second "Send table data" column with the inverse condition (`{{Find Contacts at Company}}?.peopleCount >= 3`) only fires when there are more contacts than needed. An upstream AI column first filters the full list down to the top picks — the AI column's prompt should ask for a **JSON array** of the selected contacts — and that AI column's output becomes the list source for this second Send table data column.

To add a second Send table data column, click **+ Add column** and select **Send table data** again. Each column is configured and named independently (Clay auto-names them "Send table data", "Send table data (2)", etc.).

**Setting up run conditions:** In the column configuration panel, scroll to **Run settings**, enable **Only run if**, and enter the condition formula.

**Note on `peopleCount` when no contacts are found:** The `peopleCount` field on "Find Contacts at Company" results is always present — when the action finds no results, it returns `peopleCount: 0` (not `undefined`). This means a condition like `peopleCount < 3` evaluates to `true` for rows with zero contacts found (since `0 < 3`), so those rows **will** be routed by the first Send table data column along with rows that have 1 or 2 contacts. If you want to exclude zero-result rows from that path, tighten the condition (for example, `peopleCount > 0 && peopleCount < 3`) or add an explicit check using `Clay.getCellStatus()`.

**Tips:**

-   Make the run conditions mutually exclusive so each row takes exactly one path and is sent only once.
-   If both Send table data columns target the same destination table, be mindful of the **Update existing rows on re-run** setting — if both columns can match the same row, one could overwrite what the other sent.

## Advanced settings

**Update existing rows on re-run**

Controls what happens when you re-run a source row that has already been sent. When on (default), re-running updates the corresponding destination row with the current source values. When off, re-running creates a new destination row instead. **Brand-new source rows — those being sent for the first time — always create a new row in the destination table, regardless of this setting.**

This setting controls row-level behavior only. It is separate from the column-level overwrite that occurs when you map a source field to an existing plain-text destination column (see [Mapping table data in the destination table](#mapping-table-data-in-the-destination-table)). Turning this setting off does not prevent column-level overwrites triggered by column mapping or by the **Auto-map existing columns** setting below.

**Auto-extract new columns**

Automatically creates new columns in the destination table for any that don't already exist.

**Auto-map existing columns**

Automatically maps incoming fields to existing destination columns that share the same name. For columns that already have a formula, the new source is appended to the existing formula. For columns without a formula (e.g., manually entered or CSV-imported data), a new extraction formula is set — **this will overwrite any existing values in those columns**.

## Mapping table data in the destination table

When you send data to a destination table, it appears in the leftmost column as **"rows from: \[source table name\]"**. The data is stored within this cell and needs to be extracted into individual columns to use it in your workflow.

**Tip:** `Auto-extract new columns` is **on by default** and automatically creates a new column for each sent field — but only for fields that don't already have a matching column in the destination table. If your destination table already has columns with plain-text (non-formula) data, those columns won't be updated automatically. Use **Add to column** below to map those fields manually, or enable `Auto-map existing columns` in the advanced settings.

To manually map data from the source column to columns in the destination table:

1.  Click into the source cell (the "rows from: \[source table name\]" cell).
2.  Hover over any field you want to extract.
3.  Click `Add to column`.
4.  Choose to either:
    -   **Create a new column**: Name the column and click `Create column`.
    -   **Map to an existing column**: Select an existing column from the dropdown.
        -   **If the column contains plain-text data** — for example, values imported from a CSV or entered manually — Clay shows a **"Data overwrite"** warning: *"Mapping to this destination column will overwrite all of its existing data. This action cannot be undone."* Confirming permanently replaces every value in that column with a formula driven by the incoming Send Table Data source. There is no merge option — only cancel or overwrite.
        -   **To keep existing data while also bringing in new data:** Instead of mapping to the existing column, use **Create a new column** to extract the incoming field into a separate column. Then add a [Merge column](https://university.clay.com/docs/table-columns-overview#merge-columns) that references both the original column and the new one — it returns the first non-empty value per row, preserving whichever source has data.
        -   If the existing column is already empty, the warning is safe to dismiss.

Repeat this process for each field you want to extract into its own column.

## Guide: Merging two tables with Send table data

When merging data from multiple source tables into a single destination table, following a few key practices helps avoid mapping errors and data loss.

**Use a new table as the destination.** Do not send one table's data directly into an existing source table — this can cause irreversible mapping conflicts. Instead, create a dedicated destination table and send data from both source tables into it. Test with a small subset of rows before running your full dataset.

**Map all necessary columns during the initial setup.** Only the columns you explicitly select during Send Table Data configuration will appear in the destination table. If you need to add columns later, open the destination table, click the source cell, and use **Add to column** in the cell details panel to map additional fields.

**Extract enrichment column fields before merging.** System-generated enrichment columns — such as **Company Table Data** in a people table — cannot be transferred as-is. Extract the specific fields you need first:

1. Click a populated **Company Table Data** cell to open the cell details panel.
2. Hover over a field and click **Add as column** to extract it into a regular column in your source table.
3. In your Send Table Data configuration, include those newly created columns alongside your other data.

**Compare filters across source tables.** When consolidating results from multiple search sources (for example, two different people search tables), review each table's source configuration to understand where results differ:

1. In each source table, click the **Edit source** icon in the source column header.
2. Review the filter settings — such as keywords, titles, and locations — and compare them across tables. Variations in company selections, exact-match toggles, or leftover filters often explain why two searches return different results.

**Prevent duplicate rows in the destination with auto-dedupe.** When multiple source tables push records to the same destination, the same record can arrive more than once — for example, the same company appearing in two different searches. To handle this automatically, enable [auto-dedupe](table-management-settings.md#auto-dedupe) on a unique identifier column in the destination table (such as domain, email address, or account ID). Clay detects duplicate values in that column and removes the newer duplicate row on arrival, keeping the oldest row by default. This is row-level deduplication: whichever row is kept survives in full; the duplicate row is deleted entirely. Auto-dedupe does not merge field values from the two rows. For coalescing a single best value from multiple columns into one (for example, the best available email from two enrichment sources), use a [Merge column](table-columns-overview.md#merge-columns) instead.

## Best practices & troubleshooting

-   There can be a **maximum of 20 tables** in the workspace-wide routing graph. **This includes tables across workbooks.** The limit counts unique destination tables reachable through the inter-table connection graph — not the number of Send Table Data columns. Connections made by **Write to Other Table**, **Execute Subroutine**, and **Route to Campaign** actions also count toward this same workspace-wide limit. If you exceed this limit, you'll see the error: *"Maximum number of table ID checks exceeded (limit: 20)"*. To work within this limit:
    -   **Lookup Single Row / Lookup Multiple Rows do not count toward this limit.** If you're using Send Table Data primarily to check whether a record exists in another table (for example, a "Do Not Contact" or "Recently Contacted" list), replace those with Lookup Rows — they return the same match result without consuming a connection slot. See [Lookup Rows](https://university.clay.com/docs/lookup-rows) for setup instructions.
    -   If multiple workbooks all write to the **same destination table**, that table counts as only **one** connection regardless of how many workbooks or columns point to it. Centralizing writes into a small number of shared destination tables can significantly reduce your connection count.
    -   This limit applies across all plans.
-   **A Send Table Data column fails with "Destination table already has the maximum number of routing sources (20)":** Each destination table can receive data from at most **20 source tables**. When a new Send Table Data connection is attempted and the destination is already at 20, Clay rejects the registration and the column fails to save. To free up a slot, open the destination table, right-click the **"Rows from: \[source table name\]"** column header, select **Edit source**, and remove any old or unused sources. Alternatively, point this workflow at a fresh destination table, which starts with zero sources.
-   **A Send Table Data column shows "Missing source id for routing action with destination \[table\_id\]":** This error means the column has no valid source registration linking it to the destination. The most common cause is **duplicating a table** that already contains a Send Table Data column — the copy loses its source-destination link and cannot run. The fix is to delete the broken Send Table Data column and create a new one from scratch: click **+ Add column → Send table data** and reselect your destination table. Avoid using table duplication as a shortcut to pre-configure a Send Table Data column — duplicated columns always need to be fully reconfigured.
-   **Data can only be sent in a linear direction** (A → B → C). In other words, loops are not possible (A → B → C → A).
    -   If you want to receive data in the table you're also sending data from, use one of these other actions:
        -   `Lookup Multiple Rows in Other Table`
        -   `Lookup Single Row in Other Table`
-   **The destination table has reached its 50,000-row limit and is no longer accepting rows — how do I continue?** Each destination table can hold a maximum of **50,000 rows** from a Send Table Data source. When the table is full, new rows from the upstream Send Table Data action will be rejected. The most reliable approach is to route the remaining rows to a **new downstream table** with a fresh source.

    To avoid sending duplicate rows to both tables, add a run condition to the new Send Table Data action:

    1.  Add a **Lookup single row** action on the upstream table that looks up each row in the **first** downstream table (match on a unique identifier such as a record ID, email, or company name).
    2.  Set the run condition on the **new** Send Table Data action to fire only **when that lookup returns empty** — meaning the row hasn't been sent to the first table yet.

    If the remaining rows still exceed 50,000, apply the same lookup-and-condition pattern into a third table.

    **Sending to a new table does not re-trigger upstream enrichments.** Send Table Data copies existing column values from the upstream table — it does not re-run any enrichment actions. However, rows in the new destination table are brand-new rows. If the new table has enrichment columns with **auto-run enabled**, those enrichments will fire on the incoming rows and consume credits. To move your data without spending additional credits, set any enrichment columns in the new destination table to **manual run**.

    **For continuous high-volume workflows** that will routinely exceed 50,000 rows, consider enabling [auto-delete in passthrough mode](incorrect_docs/auto-delete.md) from the start (Enterprise plan). This bypasses the 50,000-row cap entirely for Send Table Data sources, allowing a destination table to keep accepting rows indefinitely.

-   **"✅ Sent" means Clay dispatched the data — not that individual columns in the destination table have been populated.** The `Sent At` timestamp and `Number Of Rows Sent` confirm that Clay placed those rows into the **"rows from: [source table]"** column in the destination table. For fields that don't yet have a matching column, `Auto-extract new columns` (on by default) creates them automatically. However, if the destination table already has columns with plain-text data — for example, rows filled in manually or imported from a CSV — those existing columns won't be updated automatically. In that case, open the destination table, click the source cell, and use **Add to column** to map each field. See [Mapping table data in the destination table](#mapping-table-data-in-the-destination-table) above.
-   **Some cells show "Run condition not met" while others appear blank — what's the difference?** "Run condition not met" means the row's run condition evaluated to false and the action was deliberately skipped — no credits are consumed for those rows (any reserved credits are automatically refunded). Blank or out-of-date cells (shown with a clock icon and the tooltip "This cell is out of date") mean the action hasn't run for that row yet — for example, the run was stopped before reaching those rows, or auto-run wasn't enabled when they were added. To process the remaining rows, right-click the column header and select **Run column → Run [N] empty or out-of-date rows**. See [Run progress](run-progress.md) for a full explanation of cell states.
-   **The "Send data to table with auto-run on" confirmation dialog shows a higher cost estimate than you expect to pay.** The dialog calculates "Estimated total cost" by multiplying the per-row credit estimate by the total number of rows being sent — it does not filter for run conditions. If your Send table data column has a run condition, only rows where the condition evaluates to true will actually run and consume credits; rows that show "Run condition not met" are skipped at no cost. The dialog's own tooltip notes this is a *maximum* estimate: "actual usage may vary based on your data and configurations."
-   **All rows in the destination table show the same contact's data (for example, the same email or LinkedIn URL repeated across every row):** the field mappings within the list are referencing a fixed indexed position (like the first contact) instead of each item's own data. Delete the Send Table Data column and recreate it using **Take action on list** from the cell details panel (see [Using Send row for each item in a list](#using-send-row-for-each-item-in-a-list)), which auto-configures both the list source and the correct per-item field mappings.
-   **Some rows show `"Invalid send table data inputs … 'listData' … 'Required'"` while others succeed (using `Send row for each item in a list`):** This error means the list column had no data for that specific row — for example, an enrichment returned no results for that company, or a webhook event didn't include the expected field. Clay validates each row individually at runtime, so rows with a valid list array succeed and rows without one fail. **Fix:** Add a [run condition](https://university.clay.com/docs/conditional-runs) to the Send Table Data column so it only runs when the list column is not empty. For example, if your list column is `Find Contacts at Company`, set the condition to run only when `Find Contacts at Company` has a value.
-   **Send to Table is creating new columns in the destination table instead of populating my existing ones.** By default, `Auto-extract new columns` creates a new column for each incoming field. To route incoming data into an *existing* column instead: open the destination table, click the **"rows from: [source table name]"** cell, hover over the field you want to map (e.g., an email address), and click **Add to column** — then select an existing column from the dropdown (labeled **Map to an existing column**). Repeat for each field you want to map. If the existing column is empty, dismiss the data-overwrite warning safely. To map multiple fields at once, enable **Auto-map existing columns** in the action's advanced settings — Clay will automatically set formulas on all destination columns whose names match incoming fields. Note that for columns with manually entered or CSV-imported values, this will overwrite that existing data.
-   **Rows created by `Send row for each item in a list` don't have an automatic array-index column.** When Clay expands a list into individual rows in the destination table, it passes each item's own fields plus any additional columns you selected — but it does not include the item's numeric position in the original array. There is also no built-in row ID variable accessible in formula columns. If you need a unique identifier per expanded row — for example, to populate an External ID field for a Salesforce upsert — combine stable fields from the list item. Add a formula column in the destination table that concatenates fields which together uniquely identify each record. For employment history data, for instance, combining contact ID, company name, and start date (`{{Contact ID}} + "-" + {{Company Name}} + "-" + {{Start Date}}`) produces a stable composite key per job entry. Use enough fields to make the combination unique for your data. (Note: Clay's formula engine does not support object spread syntax like `{ ...item, _index: idx }`, so you can't pre-augment list items with an index in a formula column before sending.) **For upsert workflows, use only deterministic (stable) field values in your ID.** Avoid basing the ID on `Math.random()`: because `Math.random()` generates a new value every time the formula column re-runs, re-running the column assigns a different ID to each existing row and causes the upsert target to create duplicates instead of updating the originals.
