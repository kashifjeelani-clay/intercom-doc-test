# Hunter

Email outreach platform.

## Getting started with Hunter.io

[Hunter.io](https://www.clay.com/integrations/data-provider/hunter) helps you easily find and validate email addresses for individuals and companies, including filtering by department, all within Clay.

You can do a few things with [Hunter.io](http://hunter.io/) within Clay, including:

-   Find Emails by Company
-   Find Work Email
-   Validate Email

We'll cover how to connect Clay to Hunter. Then we'll go over each action that is available with Hunter.

But first, let's talk a little bit about data enrichment waterfalls.

## Maximize your data coverage with waterfall enrichment

[Hunter.io](https://www.clay.com/integrations/data-provider/hunter) is an amazing product for finding and verifying someone's email address. However, it's important to know it's not your only option for email enrichment.

We recommend using [Clay's waterfall data enrichment](https://www.clay.com/waterfall-enrichment) to find and verify someone's email address. This allows you to try multiple providers sequentially to maximize your data coverage.

That said, let's get into it on how to use Hunter.io with Clay!

## Connecting Clay to Hunter.io

You have two options connecting Hunter to Clay.

### Option 1: Use the Clay-managed Hunter account

This means you do not need to have a Hunter account to use the enrichment. You will be charged 2 credits per enriched cell without any need to create a Hunter account.

When you pull up the enrichment you will simply select the option for `Clay-managed Hunter account`. And you can now use the enrichment!

### Option 2: Add your own Hunter API key

Alternatively, if you already have a Hunter account, you can connect that by adding your own API key. However, it's only available for paying customers.

**Heads up!** You'll need [Clay's Starter plan ($149/mo)](https://www.clay.com/university/guide/hunter-integration-overview#) to use your own Hunter API key. It's not accessible on the free plan.

Follow this interactive tutorial with instructions on how to do that:

You can find additional instructions on [how to find your Hunter API key](https://help.hunter.io/en/articles/1970978-what-is-and-where-i-can-find-my-api-secret-key) in their help documentation.

Next, let's learn more about the actions available with the Hunter integration.
