# Referencing dynamic data from other columns

Reference data from other columns for AI prompting, formulas, and message drafting.

## Reference an endpoint from a column

You can use forward slash (`/`)  to access the menu to reference enrichment data from other columns.

## Use cases for dynamic column referencing

Dynamic referencing allows you to reference and insert fields — like a contact's name, location, or company — into formulas, prompts, or message drafts.

### Formula generator

Use dynamic data to build formulas that pull in fields like names, locations, or domains.

### Prompt editor

Referencing dynamic fields within AI enrichments is a key step for data orchestration in Clay.

The **Prompt Editor** lets you insert dynamic fields to customize content for specific use cases. For example, you can add the **Company Website** field for account research.

### Message drafting

When writing messages, you can use dynamic data to personalize content with fields like **First Name**, **Location**, or **current experience**.

## Required fields for AI prompt editors

In the **Prompt Editor**, the **Required to Run** toggle ensures your AI enrichments only run when specific fields contain data. This helps avoid errors caused by empty or incomplete rows

### Setting required fields

To mark a field as required or unnecessary:

1.  Open the **Prompt Editor** where you are configuring your enrichment.
2.  Identify the field that must contain data before the enrichment runs (e.g., **Created At**).
3.  Optionally, you can toggle **Required to Run** next to the selected field. When enabled, the cell actwill be skipped if the referenced field does not contain a value.  

4.  Save your prompt configuration.

## Types of data you can reference from enrichment columns

When working with enrichment columns in Clay, you can reference data at multiple levels:

1.  **Entire enrichment**: Access all data returned by an enrichment at once.
2.  **Entire Lists**: Reference all items in a list as a complete dataset.
3.  **Individual List Items**: Extract a specific item within a list and access all its properties.
4.  **Specific Endpoints**: Drill down into an item to reference specific fields, such as a URL or title.

### **Entire enrichment**

You can reference all the data returned by an enrichment, giving you access to every endpoint within that enrichment.

**Example**

Let's say you want to reference all the data from a **Website Summary** enrichment:

1.  Locate the **Website Summary** column, which contains the enrichment results.
2.  Select **Insert all properties** to reference the entire enrichment.

### **Entire lists**

You can reference all items within a list, giving you access to the complete set of data at once.

This is useful when you need to process or extract information for all entries in the list.

**Example**

Let's say you want to pull the first names of all employees in a list:

1.  Locate the **"people"** list, which contains multiple items.
2.  Select **Insert all items** to reference the entire list.
3.  Extract the **first\_name** property from the list with formulas.

### **Individual list items**

You can reference specific items within a list when a column returns multiple results.

Referencing an item gives you access to **all the data** contained within it, including its individual endpoints.

**Example**

Let's say you want to reference the first employee from a list of employees:

1.  Locate the **"people"** list, which contains multiple items.
2.  Expand the first item (Index **0**) to view its details.
3.  Referencing this item gives you access to all its data, such as **name**, **first\_name**, **last\_name**, and **url.**

### **Specific endpoints**

You can drill down into an **item** within a list to reference its specific fields **endpoints**. This allows you to target and pull precise details, such as a URL or title, from within an individual item.

**Example**

Let's say you want to reference the **URL** of the latest experience from a contact. You can:

1.  Locate the **"experience"** list, which contains multiple items, or in this case experiences.
2.  Expand the first item (Index **0**) to access its details.
3.  From the item, select the specific endpoint, such as url. This allows you to reference endpoints such as the **URL** of the experience, **title** of the role, **company** name, or a **summary** of the experience.

## Selecting which item to return from a list-based enrichment section

Some enrichment sections return multiple entries as a list. In **Enrich Person**, for example, the Experience section may contain several past roles for a contact — each role is one item in that list. The same applies to Education (each degree is one item), Awards (each award is one item), and other sections like Certifications, Courses, Projects, Languages, Volunteering, and Publications.

When you configure one of these sections, you'll see two controls working together:

-   **Field toggles** — the on/off switches next to each field (URL, Title, Company, etc.) that control which fields are included in the enrichment output.
-   **"For the below data, return results of the" dropdown** — selects which item in the list those field values are pulled from.

The dropdown options are:

-   **First item** — the first entry in the list
-   **Second item** — the second entry in the list
-   **Third item** — the third entry in the list
-   **Last item** — the final entry in the list, regardless of total count

Each section is independent. Choosing "second item" in the Experience section only affects Experience; Education, Awards, and every other section each have their own separate dropdown.

### Sort order

**Experience** is generally returned with the most recent role first, so "first item" typically corresponds to the person's current or most recent job. This ordering is consistent across most data providers but is not guaranteed for all sources.

**Awards, Certifications, and all other list-based sections** do not have a defined sort order — the position does not reliably indicate which entry is most recent or most significant.

If recency matters — for example, you want to personalize outreach with a contact's most recent award — do not rely on the dropdown position alone. Instead, run the enrichment without a position restriction to capture the full list, then add a **Use AI** column to identify the most recent entry based on its date.
