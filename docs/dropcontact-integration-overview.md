## Getting better email coverage with waterfall enrichments

[DropContact](https://www.clay.com/integrations/data-provider/dropcontact) is great for finding email contacts, but it's not the only way to get email data.

For better coverage on email data, we recommend using [Clay's waterfall enrichments](https://www.clay.com/waterfall-enrichment), which will let you search sequentially across multiple data providers.
