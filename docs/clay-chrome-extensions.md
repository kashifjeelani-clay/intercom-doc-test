# Clay Chrome extensions

Extract structured data from any webpage with the Clay Chrome Extension.

Clay offers two powerful Chrome extensions that help you gather and organize information from the web:

-   **Clay for Chrome** lets you extract structured data from webpages, either from a list or an individual page.
-   **Clip to Clay** allows you to quickly save entire webpages to your Clay tables.

Both tools integrate seamlessly with your Clay workspace, making it easier to collect, organize, and act on web data.

## Clay for Chrome

The Clay for Chrome extension allows you to extract structured data from webpages. You can capture data from a single page, lists across multiple pages, or even custom-defined structures. Once extracted, the data can be added directly to your Clay table, downloaded as a CSV, or copied to your clipboard.

**Note:** Clay for Chrome does not work on professional networking sites. To capture contacts from professional profiles, use the [Clip to Clay extension](clip-to-clay-extension.md) instead — it adds a one-click button on professional profile pages and runs enrichments automatically once a person is added to your table. For other professional networking workflows, [Exportly](https://www.exportly.ai/) is a Clay partner extension built for professional networking.

### Autodetected lists

The extension automatically detects list-like structures on the page and formats them into a table.

With autodetected lists, you can:

-   Export the list as a CSV or copy it to your clipboard.
-   Add to Clay by opening the list in a new window and saving it directly to your table.

### Custom recipes

You can create custom recipes to extract data in two main formats:

-   **Pages with lists.** Extract multiple items from a structured list, such as a directory or table.
-   **Individual pages.** Extract specific data from single-item pages, such as profiles or product pages.

### Creating a list recipe

To create a recipe that extracts data from list-style pages:

1.  [Install the Clay for Chrome extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/clay-for-chrome/acmfklpkefjlldbkdgmjoiknfgidadoh?hl=en).
2.  Open the Clay for Chrome extension on a webpage with a list.
3.  Click `Select Data to Add from Page`.
4.  Choose `Select a List` and click multiple items to help the extension detect patterns.
5.  Add attributes for each item:
    -   For images, select the `Image Attribute` (e.g., logos).
    -   For text, select the `Text Attribute` (e.g., name, location).
6.  Repeat this process for each attribute you want to capture.
7.  Name and save your recipe.

### Creating an individual page recipe

To create a recipe for scraping structured data from profile or detail pages:

1.  Open the Clay for Chrome extension on the page you want to scrape.
2.  Click `Select Data to Add from Page`, then choose `Select a Single Attribute`.
3.  Map each attribute you want to extract:
    -   For example: name, website, or Crunchbase URL.
4.  Adjust the `URL Matching` settings to apply the recipe to similar pages:
    -   Replace specific URL components with variables (e.g., `:company_name`).
5.  Name and save your recipe.

## Applying recipes at scale with Find Data from Page

After creating a recipe with the Clay for Chrome extension, you can run it automatically against a column of URLs in a Clay table using the **Find Data from Page** integration (listed under **Clay Scrapers** when adding a column). This scales web scraping to large lists of structurally similar pages without manual effort.

### Scraping a directory and its sub-pages

A common workflow is scraping a directory listing to collect entry URLs, then extracting detailed data from each entry's sub-page:

1.  **Scrape the directory page.** Use the Clay for Chrome extension to extract the list of entries (including their sub-page URLs) and import the results into a Clay table.

2.  **Create an individual page recipe.** Open the extension on one of the sub-pages and build a recipe that maps the fields you need (see [Creating an individual page recipe](#creating-an-individual-page-recipe)).

3.  **Add a Find Data from Page column.** In your Clay table, click **+ Add column** and select **Find Data from Page** under Clay Scrapers. Map the input to the sub-page URL column in your table.

4.  **Run the integration.** Clay applies your recipe to every URL in the column and returns the scraped data for each row.

### Consolidating data from multiple tables

If the scraper saves results into separate tables, use [Send Table Data](send-table-data.md) to route all records into a single table. New rows from future scrapes are sent automatically, keeping all data in one place.
