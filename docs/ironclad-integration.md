# Ironclad integration

Retrieve and utilize detailed workflow information, automatically populate data into internal systems, and send structured contract updates.

Ironclad is a contract lifecycle management platform that streamlines contract creation, negotiation, execution, and post-signature management.

With this integration, you can retrieve and utilize detailed workflow information, automatically populate data into internal systems, and send structured contract updates via Slack.

## **Enriching data with Ironclad**

1.  While in a Clay table, click `Add enrichment` and search for `Ironclad`.
2.  Under `Integrations`, select `Run HTTP Request in Ironclad`.
3.  In the modal, you will be asked to `Select Ironclad account`.
    -   If you haven't already connected your Ironclad account, click `+ Add account` and go through authentication.
