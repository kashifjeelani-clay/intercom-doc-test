# Clearbit integration overview

B2B data solutions for lead generation and marketing personalization.

# **Getting started with Clearbit**

Clearbit in Clay offers powerful data enrichment actions to retrieve company and person information, including logos, contacts, and domains, based on website domains or email addresses.

There are many actions you can do with Clearbit, including:

-   Find Domain from Company Name
-   Find Logo
-   Enrich Company
-   Enrich Person and Company
-   Find Contacts

We'll cover how to connect Clay to Clearbit, then we'll go over each action that is available with Clearbit.

But first let's talk a bit about data enrichment waterfalls.

## **Getting better email coverage with waterfall enrichments**

Clearbit is great for finding email contacts, but it's not the only way to get this data.

For better coverage on email data, we recommend using [Clay's waterfall enrichments](https://www.clay.com/waterfall-enrichment), which will let you search sequentially across multiple data providers.

Learn more on how to use Clay waterfalls with this [Clay University lesson](https://www.clay.com/university/lesson/enrich-people-waterfalls-clay-101).

That said, let's get into it on how to use Clearbit with Clay!

## **Connecting with Clay with Clearbit**

### **Option 1: Use the Clay-managed Clearbit account**

By default, Clearbit enrichments will use the Clay-managed Clearbit account. This means that any new enrichment will charge the designated credit amount. Simply pull up any Clearbit enrichment within Clay to use the Clay-managed Clearbit account.

### **Option 2: Add your own Clearbit API key**

If you are currently on a paid plan, you can use your own Clearbit account within Clay through an API key.

**Important:** API key usage is only available on paid plans. Please upgrade to access the API key.

For more information on how to find your Clearbit API key, please see reference [Clearbit's documentation](https://help.clearbit.com/hc/en-us/articles/6045527495191-Access-your-Clearbit-API-key). Please note that API keys are available for Clearbit accounts created in 2023 and earlier. If you signed up in 2024, API keys are not available regardless of plan.

You can add your Clearbit API key through the enrichment panel. Below is an example of where add your API key within the enrichment panel.

**Rate limits:** Enrichment requests sent through your own Clearbit API key are subject to the rate limits on your Clearbit account. If you see a `Retried but failed: Rate limit exceeded` error — for example, "Limit is 15 requests per minute" — that limit is enforced by Clearbit for your specific API key based on your account's plan. To check your limit or request an increase, refer to your Clearbit account settings or contact Clearbit support directly.
