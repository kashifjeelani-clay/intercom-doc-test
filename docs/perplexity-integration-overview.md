# Perplexity integration overview

AI-powered conversational search engine providing accurate, real-time answers

## Perplexity Overview

With Perplexity, you can search the web for information with AI or use a non-online model.

## Accessing the Perplexity integration

To access Perplexity, click **Add Enrichment** in the top-right corner and search for “Perplexity” in the bar. Select **Perplexity AI**. Each enriched cell costs 1 credit.

## **Using the Perplexity integration**

**Step 1: Select the Perplexity integration**

You can access the Perplexity integration through the enrichment search bar.

**Step 2: Select Perplexity model**

In the Model dropdown menu, select the appropriate model based on your needs. For more information on each model, please visit Perplexity’s [documentation on its Sonar models](https://docs.perplexity.ai/guides/model-cards).

**Step 3 (Optional): Limit citations to specific domains**

If you want to restrict citations to certain sources, enable the “Only use certain domains for citations” option.

In the “Enter Value…” field, type a comma-separated list of domains (e.g., [example.com](http://example.com/), [trustedsource.org](http://trustedsource.org/)). Only citations from the specified domains will be used.

**Step 4: Enter prompt**

In the **Prompt** field, type the prompt for which you want to generate completions. This will guide the model in producing the responses or outputs based on your input.

**Step 5: Enter system prompt (optional)**

In the **System Prompt** field, enter a brief instruction to guide the model’s tone and behavior. This optional prompt helps the model align responses with your specific needs.

**Step 6: Configure run settings**

To run this enrichment only under specific conditions, enter a formula so the column updates only when the formula is true.

**Autoupdate**: By default, auto-update enriches new rows as they’re added. Toggle this off if you don’t want auto-updates, though this may result in stale data.

**Conditional Run**: Use a formula to specify conditions for running this enrichment. Learn more in [this Clay University lesson](https://www.clay.com/university/lesson/ai-formulas-conditional-runs-clay-101).

Now you can run your Perplexity integration within your Clay table!
