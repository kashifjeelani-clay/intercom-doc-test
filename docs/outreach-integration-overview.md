# Outreach integration

AI-powered sales platform.

Outreach is a sales engagement platform that helps sales teams automate and optimize their outreach campaigns.

With this integration, you can create and update prospects, look up existing prospect data, add prospects to sequences, and find mailbox IDs in Outreach directly from Clay.

## Enriching data with Outreach

1.  While in a Clay table, click `Add enrichment` and search for `Outreach`.
2.  Under `Integrations`, select one of the Outreach options.
3.  In the modal, you will be asked to `Select Outreach account`.
    -   If you haven't already connected your Outreach account, click `+ Add account` and go through authentication.

### `Action` Update prospect

Use this action to update existing prospect records in Outreach.

-   **ID**
-   **Email**
-   **Basic information like name, company, title, etc. (Optional)**
-   **Address information (Optional)**
-   **Contact preferences (Optional)**

_Note: The **Owner** field is not supported by Clay's native Outreach "Update prospect" action. To update a prospect's owner from Clay, use an [HTTP API](https://university.clay.com/docs/http-api-integration-overview) column to send a `PATCH` request to the [Outreach Prospect Relationships API](https://developers.outreach.io/api/reference/prospect/prospect-relationships). You can retrieve Outreach user IDs using the [Outreach Users API](https://developers.outreach.io/api/reference/user/paths/~1users/get)._

### `Action` Create prospect

Use this action to create new prospect records in Outreach.

**Inputs**

-   **Email** — To add multiple email addresses to a prospect, enter them comma-separated in the same field (e.g., `email1@domain.com, email2@domain.com`).
-   **Account ID (Optional)** — The Outreach account ID to associate the prospect with. When provided, the prospect is linked to the corresponding account in Outreach.
-   **Basic information like name, company, title, etc. (Optional)**
